      \  COMMENT: The metadata stored in this section should be used todescribe the\
      \ experiment. Metadata necessary for interpreting the data is storedwith the\
      \ data. MORE_INFO: General experimental metadata, including animalstrain, experimental\
      \ protocols, experimenter, devices, etc, are stored under'general'. Core metadata\
      \ (e.g., that required to interpret data fields) isstored with the data itself,\
      \ and implicitly defined by the file specificationis to use free-form text fields,\
      \ such as would appear in sentences or paragraphsfrom a Methods section. Metadata\
      \ fields are text to enable them to be moregeneral, for example to represent\
      \ ranges instead of numerical values. Machine-readablemetadata is stored as\
      \ attributes to these free-form datasets. All entriesin the below table are\
      \ to be included when data is present. Unused groups(e.g., intracellular_ephys\
      \ in an optophysiology experiment) should not becreated unless there is data\
      \ to store within them."
